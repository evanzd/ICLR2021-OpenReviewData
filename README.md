## Descriptions

This Jupyter Notebook contains the data crawled from ICLR 2022 OpenReview webpages and their visualizations. The list of submissions (sorted by the average ratings) can be found here.


## Prerequisites
* python 3.7
* selenium
* pandas
* seaborn
* imageio
* wordcloud
* tqdm
* [`edgewebdriver`](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)
  * NOTE: You can also use `chromedriver` by setting `driver = webdriver.Chrome('chromedriver.exe')`.


## Crawl Data
1. Run `crawl_paperlist.py` to crawl the list of papers (~0.5h).
2. Run `crawl_reviews.py` to crawl the reviews (~1.5h).
   * NOTE: currently only review ratings are crawled.


## Visualization
